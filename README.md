## Developer guide

### Main technologies

 - ClojureScript
 - Reagent
 - Material UI
 - re-com
 - MySQL

### How to start
#### Important git business
This project probably receives commits and is being worked on with both CRLF and LF line endings. This means that you should set your git config to handle pulling and pushing files with correct line endings for your OS.

```
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

#### Get the codes
- Make sure you have git installed
- Clone the Coffeepot repo to your computer:
	```
	$ git clone xxxxxxxxxxxxx
	```
- We love coffee, but we also love branches so just for the sake of branching:
	```
	$ git checkout -b awesome-dev-branch
	```
#### Install dependencies etc.
```
$ lein install
$ npm init -y
$ npm install mysql2 --save
$ npm install cypress --save-dev
$ npm install sequelize --save
$Â npm install npx -g
$ npm install sequelize-cli --save-dev 
```

#### MySQL database

##### Database tool such as DBeaver

First download your choice of database tool with MySQL compatibility. Here we install DBeaver.
DBeaver can be downloaded from: https://dbeaver.io/download/

DBeaver can be started with:
```
$ dbeaver
```

##### Installation

MySQL database can be installed directly on your machine
```
$ ./db/scripts/install-mysql.sh
```
  
or it can be run in a docker container
  
First add yourself to docker group
```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ newgrp docker #OR maybe better that you restart your computer
```

Create and start the database.
```
$ ./db/scripts/create-mysql-docker.sh
``` 

Get into the MySQL and create a database for coffeepot. Default password for user root: root
``` 
$ docker exec -it coffee-devdb mysql -uroot -p
mysql> CREATE DATABASE coffeepot_dev;
``` 

#### Access locally running MySQL database as root.
```
$ mysql -u root -h localhost -p
```

#### Access docker MySQL database as root.
```
$ docker exec -it coffee-devdb mysql -uroot -p
```
#### Setup DBeaver
- Create new Connection
- Select MySql as the database type
- Fill in the general database details:
  ```
  Server Host: localhost
  Port: 3306
  Database: coffeepot_dev
  User name: root
  Password: root
  ```
- Open the *Driver properties* tab and set *allowPublicKeyRetrieval* to true
- Click *Test connection*
  - If database connection test is successful the opening popup should say 'Connected (*n* ms)'

#### Migrate database with Sequelize CLI
Going up:
```
$ npx sequelize db:migrate
```
Undoing migration:
```
$ npx sequelize db:migrate:undo
```

#### Seed database
Sequelize can be used to seed data to the database.
```
$ npx sequelize db:seed --seed db/seeders/20190621163301-demo-user.js
$ npx sequelize db:seed:undo --seed db/seeders/20190621163301-demo-user.js
```

#### Initialize app for development
 > $ ./init-dev.sh

#### Start the app locally
 > $ ./start-coffeepot.sh
 
### Testing
#### Cypress testing
All test related code can be found in the folder cypress
##### Initial folder structure
- fixtures: Contains data to be used in tests
- integration: Tests related to integration with other systems, like firebase authentication
- plugins: to load plugins if needed
- support: supporting functionality for tests

##### Running tests
To start the UI for running cypress tests, run the cypress script defined in package.json
> $ npm run cypress

When prompted for a project, choose the root folder for the coffeepot repository. It will automatically look for the cypress folder and list all the tests for you. You can now run tests one by one or all of them. Have fun with test driven development!
  
### Code analysis
#### Kibit
[Kibit](https://github.com/jonase/kibit) searches code patterns that could be rewritten.

To run kibit code analyzer:
  > $ lein kibit
